1. In code below "Mark" is a string.  What is name?
```js
var name = "Mark";   //var creates a box and name is the label of the box and "mark" is the string assigned to name.
```

2. Find the error if any
```js
  var product cost = 3.45;  // space between product and cost
```

3. Write `Right or Wrong` next to the code below.

```js
  "Hello World"     //right
  'Hello World"     // wrong
  "Hello World'     // wrong
  'Hello World'    // right
```

## Write `VALID` and `INVALID` infront of the variable name defined below
```js
var man;      valid
var 1girl;    invalid
var woman3;    valid
var -girl;    invalid
var blackDog;  valid
var 42;        invalid
var $42;       valid
var userName;  valid
var x, y, z;   valid
var x = 5, y = 6, z = 7;  valid
var x = 5 + 10 + 2;    invalid
```

## Basic Operations

Mathematical Operations:

Solve this using mathematical operations. (+, -, *, / , etc)

```js
var amount = 2080;
// Define a new variable and store the value that is 80 less then the value of amount.      
let subVar =amount-80;

// Define a new variable and store the value that is 200 more then the value of amount.     
let addVar=amount+200;

// Define a new variable and store the value that is 4 times the value of amount.          
 let mulVar = amount*4;

// Define a new variable and store the reminder when the value of amount is  divided by 21.  
let divVar = amount/21;
```

Logical Operation:

Solve this using logical operations. (<, >, &&, ||)

```js
var johnAge = 45;
var markAge = 35;

// Check who is older eithe John or Mark         
johnAge > markAge; 
true
                                
// Check who is younger     
  johnAge < markAge;  
  false

// Check if their age is equal     
johnAge == markAge
// Create a new variable and assign the age of john to new variable.  
      let ages;
      ages = johnAge;
// Check if john is equal to or greater then mark.
    johnAge >= markAge;
    true
      
// Check if john is less then or equal to mark.
    newAge <= markAge;
    false

// Calculate the average age of john and mark and assign to a new variable.
  let avgage = (johnAge+markAge)/2;
```
